# VLG-Project
This is my github rep for the vlg project I am doing
I have created two files

The first file named "VLG_CNN" contains my attempt to solve the problem using cnn and the seconda file named "Xgboost" uses xgboost in conjuntion with random forest to do the classification

The other two files are just the model which i have exported that can be directly import using joblib and are pretrained

Ill be updating the files if I find any better methods to do the classification probelm and as my knowledge and graps on the topic increase
